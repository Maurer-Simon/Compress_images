**Compress Images**

**Description**:
This Python script is designed to automate the process of scaling down all the images in the RLF-Beladung project. The purpose of scaling down the images is to improve website loading speed when accessing it online, as every picture needs to be loaded. The script iterates through all the images in the project directory, resizes them to smaller dimensions, and saves the scaled-down versions. This optimization helps in reducing the file sizes of the images, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the website.

**Features**:
- Automatic resizing of all images in the project directory.
- Reduction of image dimensions to improve website loading speed.
- Preserves aspect ratio to maintain image quality.

**Usage**:
1. Place the script in the folder with jpg images.
2. Set the quality threshold.
3. Edit constants for width and height.
4. Run the script.
5. All images in the project directory will be scaled down automatically.
